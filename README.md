# Native declarative frameworks in Expo projects
This repository is an example of how you can use Jetpack Compose 
and SwiftUI in your React Native Expo projects.
This repository is an addition to my articles on Medium:
1. [Expo Native View with Jetpack Compose](https://medium.com/@someSOAP/expo-native-view-with-jetpack-compose-68cf8028efa5)
2. [Expo Native View with SwiftUI](https://medium.com/@someSOAP/expo-native-view-with-swiftui-8e3c89a160fd)

## Content
This repository contains three branches - ios and android,
which contains code only for corresponding platform,
and main branch with all code merged.
Each commit in each branch relates to specific step from the articles.
